## Usage

### Starting the Bot

```

You should see:
```
‚úÖ Bot logged in as YourBotName#1234
```

The bot is now online and ready to use!

### Commands

In any Discord channel where the bot has access, type:

- `!assignments` - Fetch and display upcoming assignments
- `!canvas` - Alternative command (same as !assignments)

### Example Output

When you run the command, the bot will display:

```
üìö Assignments Due in Next 3 Days

1. CMPUT 201 Lab 5
Due: Mon, Oct 7, 11:59 PM
Course: CMPUT 201 - Practical Programming Methodology
https://canvas.ualberta.ca/courses/12345/assignments/67890

2. MATH 125 Assignment 3
Due: Wed, Oct 9, 11:59 PM
Course: MATH 125 - Linear Algebra I
https://canvas.ualberta.ca/courses/23456/assignments/78901

Total: 2 assignments
```

If there are no assignments due:
```
üìö Upcoming Assignments
No assignments due in the next 3 days! üéâ
```

## Configuration

### Changing the Time Window

By default, the bot shows assignments due within 3 days. To change this, edit line 27 in `index.js`:

```javascript
threeDaysFromNow.setDate(threeDaysFromNow.getDate() + 3); // Change 3 to your preferred number
```

### Adding Custom Commands

You can add more command triggers by modifying the message handler around line 111:

```javascript
if (message.content.toLowerCase() === '!assignments' || 
    message.content.toLowerCase() === '!canvas' ||
    message.content.toLowerCase() === '!homework') { // Add your custom command
```

## Troubleshooting

### Bot doesn't respond to commands

**Solution:**
1. Make sure **MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT** is enabled in Discord Developer Portal
2. Click **"Save Changes"** after enabling
3. Restart the bot
4. Wait a few minutes for Discord to update

### "Used disallowed intents" error

**Solution:** You haven't enabled MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT. See step 4 in the Discord Bot setup above.

### Canvas API errors

**Solution:**
1. Verify your Canvas token is correct and hasn't expired
2. Test the token manually:
   ```bash
   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" https://canvas.ualberta.ca/api/v1/courses
   ```
3. Generate a new token if needed

### Bot shows offline

**Solution:**
1. Check that `DISCORD_TOKEN` in `.env` is correct
2. Make sure the bot process is running (`npm start`)
3. Verify the bot is still in your server (check member list)

### No assignments showing but you know you have some

**Solution:**
1. Check that assignments have due dates set in Canvas
2. Verify assignments are due within the 3-day window
3. Make sure you're enrolled in the courses as a student

## Security Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Security Practices:**

- Never share your `.env` file
- Never commit `.env` to Git (add it to `.gitignore`)
- Never share your Canvas API token
- Never share your Discord bot token
- Regenerate tokens immediately if they're exposed
- Only run this bot in trusted environments

## API Rate Limits

- Canvas API: Generally allows 3000 requests per hour per token
- This bot makes one request per course, so it should be well within limits
- Avoid running the command excessively to prevent rate limiting
